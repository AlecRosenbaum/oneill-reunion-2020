				Hello everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
				The Reunion is currently scheduled for July 9-12, 2021!  We are
				super exicted to see everyone after this long quanretine.
				Because of the changes we are asking that everyone please
				re-rsvp so that we have a firm count for this year. If anyone
				is unable to make it and requires a refund just let me know!
            </p>
            <p>
				Please note that pets are not allowed at the airbnb, so please
				plan accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
				For those of us flying in, the two closest airports are the
				Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport (40 min away) and
				the Philadelphia International Airport (1.5 hrs away).
            </p>
            <p>
				We are hoping that the vaccine will be avaliable to everyone
				before the reunion takes place, but in order to make sure that
				the gathering is safe for everyone we need to be aware of covid
				risk.  If we do not meet a certain threshold within our 'herd'
				we will need to wear masks, so please let us know once you have
				recieved the vaccine so that we can communicate any
				requirements before the reunion date.
            </p>
            <p>
				If anyone has any questions or concerns, I can be reached
				at lana@rosenbaum.io
            </p>
            <p>
				Thank You and Stay Safe!
            </p>

				Hello everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
				As the date of the reunion grows closer, it has become clear
				that holding the reunion this year would present some
				unnecessary risk and would not adhere to current state or
				federal gathering/travel guidelines. We don’t want fear of
				coronavirus infection to influence anyone’s decision to see
				their family, and will plan on postponing the reunion if at all
				possible.
            </p>
            <p>
				The current plan is to first contact the owner of the airbnb
				and hope that they will be understanding about moving
				reservation to a similar weekend next year. If that doesn’t
				work, airbnb itself has a complete refund cancellation policy
				which they have slowly been extending.  Currently they will
				refund anything booked before July 15th. We think that given
				a little more time they will extend this policy to cover our
				dates as well. We will then book something for a similar
				weekend next year.
            </p>
            <p>
				The plan would be for everything (sans date) to be the same.
				If anyone has already given us money to cover the reunion and
				would like it back just let us know.
            </p>
            <p>
				If anyone has questions or concerns about the current plan or
				about the dates next year please let us know. I can be reached
				at lana@rosenbaum.io

              lovely house on Lake Harmony!
              It has 14 bedrooms and 12 baths and sleeps 42 so there should
              be more than enough room for all of us!  There are two full
              kitchens, three decks, and two small docks!
            </p>
            <p>
              The ten single bedrooms will be offered to the parental units
              first and any leftovers will be on a first come first serve
              basis. The remaining four bedrooms have four bunk beds, we
              can set up a chart for accomodations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because it is such a large house, they ask that we provide our
              own linens, so please bring a set of sheets and towels :)
            </p>
            <p>
              There's ample parking, but only 9 spots actually in front of the
              house. There's a small lot about a mile away we can also store
              cars at, but we'd need to coordinate trips back and forth unless
              you're fine with walking.

                Because of Grandpa’s generous help with planning this reunion,
                the cost that we need to cover is about 5k. This amount
                covers the remainder of the house and also a food budget.
                Alec and I will be purchasing food for the house with the
                remaining funds. We plan to buy enough food to at least cover
                breakfast and lunch for everyone for each day. We're also
                planning to get reunion T-shirts!
            </p>
            <p>
                Costs for the reunion will obviously fluctuate with the number
                of people who actually plan on attending.  For 35 people, the
                cost is only $150 per person for four days and three nights.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div style="width: 100%">
              <h3>Costs</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>AirBnb - $11,899.38 ($3,400/night x 3 nights + cleaning/service/occupancy fees + taxes)</li>
                <li>Shirts - $500 (est, $12/person * 40 people)</li>
                <li>Food + consumables - $2500 (est)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                That totals around $15k. Grandpa covered 10k of that for us. The
                remaining 5k is being split among the adults attending.
                $5k/35 = $142, which we've rounded up to $150 to give us a
                buffer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plan with respect to food is still a little bit up in the
                the air, at least in that we don't have grocery lists to share
                (yet). The current budget allots ~$70 per person for the whole
                trip, which ends up being around ~$15-20/person/day.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current plan is to go to costco on the way up, and buy a
                lot of food/drink that should sustain us the entire trip. We
                expect that this will cover breakfast/lunch/snacks + at least
                one dinner. Hopefully that would cover all food, but we haven't
                created an itemized costco shopping list yet so we can't say
                for certain.
              <p>
              </p>
                A few people have mentioned trying to get one night catered,
                which would likely impact what we eat for other meals, but
                would be really nice for those of us who will be cooking
                and cleaning the rest of the time. That being said, we
                haven't done any significant research into it yet and have
                no idea what our options would be or how much it would cost. If
                it turns out that we significantly overbudgeted for food, we'll
                individually return the difference. Otherwise, we'll plan on
                edging on the side of overbuying and everyone will have the
                option to take the remaining food home with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, $2500 of food isn't going to fit into our tiny hatchback, so
                we will be creating an itemized grocery list and asking for help
                in buying/transporting food/drink.
